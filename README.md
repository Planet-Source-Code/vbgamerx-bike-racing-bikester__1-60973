### Description

I really would give a written gurantee that you are going to like this game. See the screenshot to get some idea about the game but that wont be all. Just play it to feel it. And Please see the Help files(I have spend a lot of time on it) and Please, please vote.

JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE GETTING ABOVE 40-FPS or all excitement will be lost.
 
### More Info
 
If you dont have directX7 then you should disable some lines of code in the "modinit.bas" file coz the program does NOT USE DIRECTX as such.
